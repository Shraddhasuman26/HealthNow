But your energy, appetite, liveliness, passion and how you generally feel, is reliant on the deeper and more powerful mental, emotional and spiritual layers. This explains why there are some people who eat well, exercise and even meditate, but still suffer energy dips, general unhappiness, anxiety and feel unfulfilled. It makes no sense, right?HEALTH NOW is an application that enables you to book doctor's apppointment very easily and feasibly. To have high sustainable energy, all four of your energies must be aligned. How do you align them? By living consciously in all seven areas in the model. You see, your true source of energy comes in living a complete and fulfilling life in all seven areas.When you live consciously in each of these seven areas, your life force will shine brightly and manifest itself into high physical energy. But every time you neglect one area of life, your life force dims. Neglect more and your life force dims even further. Neglect all of them and your energy levels will plummet. For some, anxiety and depression is nothing more than a sign that you stopped climbing higher and started neglecting your love life, family, friendships, continued learning, and sense of charity and contribution.These are the parts of you that stimulate your deeper mental, emotional and spiritual health. These are the areas that give reason for your physical health to manifest itself. So, you see. Your health is so much more than nutrition, exercise and sleep." textAlignment="CENTER" wrappingWidth="490.835205078125" />
